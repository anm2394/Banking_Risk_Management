# Banking_Risk_Management
Projects done as part of curriculum at NC State focusing on Risk Modeling in Banking: Credit, Operational, Market Risk. 
This project was part of Operational Risk. Under Operational Risk, external fraud and more specifically victim fraud is a major issue. We use a set of classifiers to detect frauds in about a quarter of million transactions.
